What does it do?
<br>
- Creates a flutter project
- Uploades it to your github
- Finally, opens with either Android studio or VSCode the choice is yours.

How to use?
```
> git clone https://github.com/Tushar-OP/Flutter-Automation

> run pre-requisite.bat or Install the dependencies in pre-requisite.txt

> Open upload.py with your editor of choice, and add your github username and password, save it.
(NOTE: If you have android studio located not in the defaut location, you need to change that too in the python file)

> Move your folder to some location that you'll not change or delete, for e.g I keep mine 
in C:\ (top-level, not within any folders)

> Add the path to batch script to the environment variables, follow this; search for 'system' -> Advance System settings ->
Environment Variable -> Under system variable double click PATH -> New -> 
Paste the location to your batch script(for e.g C:\Flutter-Automation\Windows)

> Done, it's ready for use!

> Usage: create [project_name] [/ide (as: Android Studio or code: VSCode)] [/path custom_path_to_create_project]
> e.g create new_proj /ide as /path C:\users\tushar\Desktop\Flutter Projects


> EXTRAS

> Default location is desktop and default IDE is Android Studio, you can change this too,
open create.bat for editing, <br> head to line 52, change SET ide="as" to SET ide="code" 
and change SET pt="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\" to whatever location you want.
```

I will be creating the same for Linux and Mac.

If you find it useful, please star it!
